**Insights:**

After examining the dashboard data, it can be inferred that the total budget for the eight Harry Potter movies amounted to 1.4 billion dollars, with a box office gross of 7.8 billion dollars, resulting in a profit of 6.4 billion dollars. In addition, the movies consisted of 234 chapters and 166 characters.

The main characters in the Harry Potter movie franchise are Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. The total number of places depicted in the movies amounts to 74, while 61 different spell names were used throughout the series. Moreover, the total number of dialogues in the movies was 7444, with an average runtime of 147.38 minutes.

A stack bar chart was used to analyze the distribution of dialogues among the characters, revealing that Harry Potter had the highest number of dialogues followed by Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Furthermore, Gryffindor had the highest number of characters, while Hufflepuff had the lowest.

The average runtime of the movies was determined for each movie title, with The Chamber of Secrets having the highest average runtime, followed by The Goblet of Fire and The Half-Blood Prince. The reasoning behind this trend may be attributed to the fact that The Chamber of Secrets is based on the second book in the Harry Potter series, which contains more content and plot points than the first book, necessitating a longer runtime for the movie adaptation.

A funnel chart was utilized to examine the number of chapters for each movie, with The Chamber of Secrets having the highest number of chapters compared to the other movies. This is likely due to the fact that the book contains more plot points than the first book, requiring a longer runtime for the movie adaptation.

A stacked bar chart was used to analyze the gender distribution among the houses, revealing that Gryffindor had the highest number of male and female characters, with nine female and 21 male characters. This may be attributed to the fact that many of the main characters in the series are Gryffindors, which contributes to the house's prominent presence in the story.

Finally, a combinational chart was used to examine the movie budget, box office, and profit for each movie title, revealing that The Deathly Hallows Part 2 had the highest box office gross and profit compared to the other movies. This can be attributed to the fact that it is the final movie in the series, serving as the conclusion to the overarching story and generating a great deal of anticipation and excitement among fans. Additionally, the decision to release the movie in 3D likely contributed to its success, as many fans were willing to pay extra for the experience.
